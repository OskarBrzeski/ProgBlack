# Review - Group 1

## Interest of Content
The content was varied across many different areas where computer science has made a positive impact.

### Mark: Excellent (7/10)

## Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation

- The navigation bar didn't add much to the website and contained no links to any actual webpages, losing a lot of potential functionality.
- On some pages the text extended beyond the main container and into the footer leading to somewhat unreadable text.
- The links on the left sidebar were okay, but could've been jazzed up a lot more with some colour.

### Mark: Good (5/10)
