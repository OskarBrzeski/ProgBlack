# Review - Group 1
This is the review of the group project by group 1, on the 5 points listed in the marking criteria.

## Interest of Content
The content was varied across many different areas where computer science has made a positive impact.

### Mark: Excellent (7/10)

## Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation
- The visual presentation was consistent across all of the webpages but however, the colour scheme was very bland and not very visually stimulating.
- The navigation bar didn't add much to the website and contained no links to any actual webpages, losing a lot of potential functionality.
- On some pages the text extended beyond the main container and into the footer leading to somewhat unreadable text.
- The links on the left sidebar were okay, but could've been jazzed up a lot more with some colour.

### Mark: Good (5/10)

## Quality of Written Presentation
- The quality of the written presentation was very good with good use of headings and bolder text.
- The use of links and lists made it easier to understand what was being talked about.
- The author details were clear and easy to understand with the use of colons.
- There were a few grammatical and spelling errors on some of the pages.
- Overall, the content of the webpages was very good and provided a lot of useful information.

### Mark: Outstanding (8/10)

## Validity of HTML
- Most of the HTML tags and content was clear and properly formatted.
- There were a few un-paired tags, some of the div tags were not ended.
- The HTML validator picked these un-paired tags up.

### Mark: Very good (6/10)
